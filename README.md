# StrippedCustomWalker
A stripped and "dumbed down" WordPress Nav Walker. All cool and smart solutions from the original Walker for adding attributes are stripped away in favour of readability.
Many of the default css classes are removed and some are renamed. 

List of CSS Classes<br>
• menu-item<br>
• menu-item--home<br>
• menu-item--current<br>
• menu-item--has-children<br>
• menu-item--level-{$depth}<br>
